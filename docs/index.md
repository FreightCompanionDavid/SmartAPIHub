# Welcome to SmartAPIHub Documentation

## Introduction

SmartAPIHub is designed to revolutionize the way applications interact with APIs by providing logical controls that are self-improving in nature. This innovative platform leverages the power of OpenAI models to offer advanced capabilities such as image generation, understanding, and text embedding. By integrating these models, SmartAPIHub enables applications to dynamically adapt and optimize API calls for enhanced performance and functionality.

### Features

- **Image Generation**: Utilizes OpenAI's DALL-E 3 model for creating images from textual descriptions.
- **Image Understanding**: Employs GPT-4 vision preview for interpreting and understanding images.
- **Text Embedding Capabilities**: Offers text embedding features to extract meaningful representations of text.
- **Configurable API Settings and Error Handling**: Provides customizable settings for API usage and robust error handling mechanisms as outlined in the `config.json`.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed on your system.
3. Run `npm install` in the project directory to install all required dependencies.
4. Create an `.env` file in the root of the project and add your OpenAI API key as `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`, as required by the application logic and configuration.
5. Start the server by running `npm start` or `node app.js` in the terminal.
