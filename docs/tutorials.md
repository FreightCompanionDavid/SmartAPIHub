### Installing Node.js and npm

Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed on your system. If not, download and install them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installing Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install all required dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### Environment Setup

Create an `.env` file in the root of the project and add your OpenAI API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Starting the Server

To start the server, run one of the following commands in the terminal:

```
npm start
```
or
```
node app.js
```

This will launch the SmartAPIHub server, making it ready to handle requests.

## Making Your First API Call

To make your first API call, use the following code snippet:

```javascript
// Example code snippet for making an API call
```

This will send a request to SmartAPIHub to generate an image or embed text, depending on the API endpoint you choose.

## Understanding API Responses

API responses from SmartAPIHub will include various fields. Here's how to interpret some of the common ones:

- `response_field`: Description of what this field represents.

## Advanced Usage

For more complex use cases, such as configuring API settings and handling errors, refer to the `config.json` file. Here's an example of how to configure API settings:

```json
{
  "api_setting": "value"
}
